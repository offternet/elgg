This document applies only to Elgg 6 that is hosted on an Linux Apache Webserver. Depending on how your .htaccess file is configure (different among host companies) you may experience SSL failure and issues with https:// not working in a web browser. The below  code has been tested to work on Godaddy Linux Hosting. I also had issues that if a user used the www. before domain name, it wouuld not force https: so, there is code for the .htaccess file to fix this as well.

1.  Issue:  https:// will not work at all in web browser:
    (please verify your SSL Certificate for affected domain shows to be install and GREEN in cPanel).

    A. Insert below code below line in .htaccess file as directed. Insert correct domain name in code.

    # ######## Add this code to force addon or sub domain to use https://

    # (Below line will be found in the .htaccess file so place the necessary code below this line.)
	  # If you must add RewriteRules to change hostname, add them directly below (above all the others)
    
      RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\.)?yourdomainname.com$ [NC]
      RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
      RewriteRule ^ https://yourdomainname.com%{REQUEST_URI} [NC,L,R]

2. Issue: when www. is used in domain name, https:// does not work in web browser:
    A. Insert below code in your ./htaccess file.

    # (Below line will be found in the .htaccess file so place the necessary code below this line.)
	  # If you must add RewriteRules to change hostname, add them directly below (above all the others)

    # ########## Add this code to stip www to allow https:// to work:
 
     RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,QSA,NC,L]
